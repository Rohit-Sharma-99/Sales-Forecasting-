# Sales Forecasting Model

This project aims to predict the sales of items across various outlets using historical sales data. By leveraging machine learning models, we aim to accurately forecast sales, taking into account features such as item weight, visibility, outlet type, and other critical factors that influence sales. This type of model can be used by retail businesses to predict future sales and optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

## Project Description

In this project, we develop a predictive model for sales forecasting by using historical data and applying various machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the sales of items in multiple outlets by analyzing past sales data and the influence of different features on the sales performance. By building and testing different machine learning models, we aim to identify the most effective model that provides accurate and reliable sales predictions.

### Dataset

The dataset contains information on several features:

- **Item features:** Item weight, item visibility, and item type.
- **Outlet features:** Outlet size, outlet location, and outlet type (e.g., Supermarket, Grocery, etc.).
- **Sales:** The target variable, which represents the total sales of the item at the outlet.

The dataset is relatively large, and it includes several categorical and continuous features. The goal is to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and build predictive models.

## Key Project Steps

### 1. **Data Import and Exploration**

The first step of the project involves importing and exploring the dataset to understand its structure. We check for any missing values, the types of variables, and gain initial insights into the data. This step helps us to formulate the necessary steps for cleaning and preprocessing the data.

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("sales_data.csv")
data.info()  # Get info about the dataset's structure
2. Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing phase involves several tasks:

Handling Missing Data: We check if there are any missing values in the dataset and decide on how to handle them. For continuous features, missing values are often filled with the mean or median, while categorical features may be filled with the mode or a predefined value.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features can provide additional insights. For instance, we can create a New_Item_Type feature or encode categorical variables like Outlet_Size into numerical values. We also explore and analyze the relationships between features and the target variable (Sales).

Feature Encoding: Many machine learning models require numerical data. Categorical features such as Outlet_Type and Item_Type are encoded using techniques like Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.

python
Copy code
# Handling missing values and feature encoding
data.fillna(data.mean(), inplace=True)  # For continuous variables
data['Item_Type'] = data['Item_Type'].astype('category').cat.codes  # Encoding categorical features
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is essential for understanding the data distributions and relationships. Visualizing the dataset helps uncover trends and patterns that can inform model building. We use various plotting libraries to create visualizations:

Histograms and Boxplots to analyze distributions of features and sales.
Correlation Matrices to see the relationships between numerical variables.
Scatter Plots to explore how features like item weight and visibility relate to sales.
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Plotting a correlation matrix
corr_matrix = data.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm", fmt=".2f")
plt.title("Correlation Matrix")
plt.show()
4. Model Selection and Training
We train several machine learning models and compare their performances. The models chosen for this task include:

Linear Regression: A baseline model to predict continuous values based on linear relationships.
Ridge & Lasso Regression: Extensions of linear regression that apply regularization to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.
Decision Tree: A tree-based model that splits data based on feature values.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance.
XGBoost and LightGBM: Advanced gradient boosting algorithms that are particularly effective for structured/tabular data.
We evaluate each model using common metrics such as:

R2 Score: Measures how well the modelâ€™s predictions fit the actual data.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Quantifies the error between the predicted and actual sales values.
python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Example: Linear Regression Model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R2 Score: {r2}")
5. Hyperparameter Tuning
To further improve model performance, hyperparameter tuning is done using techniques like RandomizedSearchCV. This allows us to search for the best combination of hyperparameters for our models, ensuring better performance and accuracy.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV

# Hyperparameter tuning example for Random Forest
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
    'max_depth': [10, 20, 30],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

grid_search = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestRegressor(), param_distributions=param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=-1)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Best Parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
6. Model Evaluation
Once we have trained the models and tuned their hyperparameters, the next step is to evaluate them. We use cross-validation to assess the models' generalizability and avoid overfitting.

Additionally, we assess feature importance to understand which features most influence the sales predictions.

python
Copy code
# Evaluating feature importance with Random Forest
importances = model.feature_importances_
feature_names = X_train.columns
importance_df = pd.DataFrame({'Feature': feature_names, 'Importance': importances})
importance_df = importance_df.sort_values(by='Importance', ascending=False)
7. Final Model and Prediction
After evaluating multiple models, we select the best-performing one based on the evaluation metrics and use it to make predictions on the test data or on new, unseen data.

python
Copy code
# Making predictions with the selected model
final_model = grid_search.best_estimator_  # Using the best model from grid search
predictions = final_model.predict(new_data)
